I have committed to git for the first time for problem 0.1, which can be viewed in the commit history.

This “problem” focuses on correct styling for your solutions to Problems 1 and 2.

#problem 1

``` {r problem 1}
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
summary(penguins)
nrow(penguins)
ncol(penguins)
mean(penguins$flipper_length_mm,na.rm = T)


```

```
